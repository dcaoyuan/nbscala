OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=Supports plain Scala projects.
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Support for general Scala projects. \
    A Scala project can compile a Scala source root, build a JAR from it, run JUnit-based tests, create Javadoc, and run or debug an application with a main class.

LBL_No_Main_Classs_Found=Class "{0}" does not have a main method.
LBL_No_Build_XML_Found=The project does not have a build script.
# NOTE TO TRANSLATORS: This is a folder name, do not use odd characters:

# J2SEProjectGenerator
# NOTE TO TRANSLATORS: COMMENT_* keys are used to create the initial project.properties
# for a project. The properties file format only accepts ISO-8859-1 characters in their
# raw form, i.e. Western European scripts. Any other characters (e.g. Asian) will be stored
# in the properties file correctly but be unreadable in text mode: \u1234 syntax is used.
# (The proper characters will be displayed only if the file is opened in the table editor.)
